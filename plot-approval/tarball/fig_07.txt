CPU time evolution of the ACTS-based ITk main pass reconstruction, \textit{Fast} configuration, measured on a single core of a Intel Xeon Gold 6148. All measurements were taken on the same machine and the same set of $t\bar{t}$ events at $\langle \mu \rangle = 200$ with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, using the ITk Layout 03-00-00. The measured reconstruction time is scaled to HS23$\times$s. On a high level, the major changes include: (1) series of optimizations on the pixel clustering, (2) lowering the $p_T$ reconstruction cut from 1 GeV to 900 MeV, (3) optimization of the strip clustering, (4) tuning the redundancy of the pixel seeding, (5) merging the ambiguity resolution into the track finding.
