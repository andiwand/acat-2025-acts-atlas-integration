Average execution time (in arbitrary units) of the strip clustering algorithms as a function of the number of reconstructed strip clusters, obtained with the non-ACTS implementation and an ACTS-based version. The measurement was taken on the same machine and the same set of $t\bar{t}$ events at $\langle \mu \rangle = 200$ with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, using the ITk Layout 03-00-00. Timing improvements with the ACTS-based version are achieved while maintaining identical physics results.
