Improvements and current status of the ACTS-based ITk main pass reconstruction
<INTRO>
The ATLAS experiment is carrying out an extensive upgrade effort for Phase-II of the LHC, including a new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) [ATLAS-TDR-025, ATLAS-TDR-030]. One crucial part is a comprehensive software upgrade programme, whose goal is not only to achieve the ultimate physics performance, but at the same time to modernise the software technology, to make best use of upcoming and future processing technologies and ensure maintainability throughout the operation of the experiment. In order to achieve these objectives, the ATLAS Collaboration has decided to extensively use ACTS [Ai X. et al., A Common Tracking Software Project, Comput Softw Big Sci 6, 8 (2022)] for the Phase-II reconstruction software. ACTS is an experiment-independent toolkit for track reconstruction, which is designed from the ground up for thread-safety and high performance. It is built to accommodate different experiment deployment scenarios, and also serves as community platform for research and development of new approaches and algorithms in tracking. Using ACTS for ATLAS Phase-II reconstruction software allows us to directly profit from its thread-safety, high performance and code maintainability. Additionally, the migration to using ACTS also involves changes to the ATLAS Event-Data-Model [ATL-SOFT-PROC-2015-003] which, including adoption of the ACTS track representation, is interfaced with the ATLAS xAOD IO infrastructure [ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001].

In this contribution, the current status of the ACTS integration for the ATLAS ITk track reconstruction is presented; this builds on top of the previous status update [ATL-SOFT-PROC-2025-012]; when possible, physics and/or CPU performance comparisons with the non-ACTS counterparts are presented. The performance of several algorithms in the track reconstruction chain is studied. The clusterization is the first step of event reconstruction: adjacent readout channels with a hit are grouped together in clusters for the ITk Pixel and Strip Detectors, respectively. A subsequent step produces space points, which are three-dimensional representations of clusters. Pixel and strip space points are used in the seeding stage of the track finding based on a combinatorial Kalman filter that is seeded from triplet space point combinations. For the efficiency and resolution plots, tracks are matched to true particles using a truth-matching probability of 50\%. This probability is defined as the ratio of the number of hits shared between a track and a particle and the total number of hits on the track. Pixel hits have a double relative weight with respect to strip measurements. All results are obtained using the ITk Layout 03-00-00 [IDTR-2023-05].

Additionally, the ACTS \textit{Fast} configuration is included, which has been subject to a series of CPU time optimizations in the last months. This configuration is optimized for a potential high-level trigger application and modeled after the pre-existing Athena non-ACTS \textit{Fast} configuration [ATLAS-TDR-029-ADD-1].
