Tracking efficiency as a function of the pseudo-rapidity $\eta$ of the associated truth particle using the ITk Layout 03-00-00 for $t\bar{t}$ events at $\langle \mu \rangle = 200$. ACTS-based chains are compared to the non-ACTS implementation. Lower efficiency is observed in the barrel region $|\eta| < 1.5$. The ACTS-based fast configuration drops further in the endcap region $|\eta| > 2.0$ which is due to CPU optimization trade-offs and under investigation.
